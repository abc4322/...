options exist for contemplative experiences.""
""While numerous contemplative practices are noted
in the Tree of Contemplative Practices (CCMS, n.d.b) and in Eastern traditions (e.g.,
Buddhism, Hinduism), meditation is the most common form of contemplative practice.
While numerous methods of meditation occur, the vast majority fall along a continuum
between two categories, either concentrative, which is turning-off, or mindfulness, which
is opening-up one’s awareness to the external world (Cahn & Polich, 2006; Kabat-Zinn et
al., 1992; Ornstein, 2008). In Buddhism these two categories are referred to as shamatha,
meaning calming, and vipashyana, meaning insight or transformation (Thurman, 2006).
When turning-off awareness, thoughts and sensory responses related to the environment
are restricted by deeply focusing the mind on a single point such as a mantra, prayer,
one’s breath, or a meditation object such as a flower, flame, or religious article. While
this type of meditation is also demonstrated in other religious customs, the definition and
purpose differ from one faith tradition to another. When practicing centering prayer in the
Christian tradition a mantra is only used to bring one’s attention to the present moment
and it is released once the mind is present (Keating, 2009).
The second category of meditation, opening-up of awareness, is sometimes
identified as mindfulness or insight meditation. It involves being intensely attuned to
one’s consciousness and senses. Opening-up meditation is approached with a spirit of
curiosity and acceptance while refraining from judgment. With concentrated attention in
the present moment, the practitioner follows and observes thoughts and sensations with
the goal of insight through self-observation (Hofmann et al., 2010; Kabat-Zinn et al.,
1992; Ornstein, 2008; Thurman, 2006). Christian contemplation, a profound spiritual and
divine union with God (Keating, 2003), may loosely be compared to opening-up
meditation. However, according to Keating contemplation is an imprecise practice that
cannot be controlled. When engaging in contemplation, the practitioner experiences a
deepened encounter with the Divine transcending self with the intention of receiving
enlightenment. Centering prayer may be one vehicle of entry to a level of God
consciousness (Keating, 2009; Rohr, 1999).""",Yes,"""While numerous methods of meditation occur, the vast majority fall along a continuum

definitions appear to be grounded in the individual work of Hans Selye (1956), a
prominent endocrinologist, and Richard S. Lazarus (1966), a well-known psychologist
both interested in the scholarship of stress. The generally accepted definition attributed to
Lazarus defines stress as the emotional response when life “demands exceed the personal
and social resources the individual is able to mobilize” (Stress Management from Mind
Tools, n.d., para. 7).
According to the American Institute of Stress (American Institute of Stress [AIS],
n.d.) stress can be categorized as (a) acute, an episodic stress experience exhibited as an
immediate fight or flight response to circumstances such as earning a bad grade or
frustration with a roommate; (b) chronic, ongoing and often ignored experiences that may
be triggered by issues such as tuition bills and unhappy relationships; (c) eustress, stress
associated with positive events such as an athletic performance or excitement about an
upcoming event; or, (d) distress, constant daily stress related to depression and financial
difficulties that cannot be disregarded. All types of stress may have a physiological
response, but chronic stress is the primary culprit as it is ongoing stress that has not been
reconciled. Virtually all body systems are vulnerable to stress including the nervous,
musculoskeletal, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrine, gastrointestinal, and reproductive
systems (AIS, n.d.).""","","","","","","",Stress,"","","","","","",1,"",The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS),0 - 40,v,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",Yes,T-Test for independent Samples; Other: ANCOVA,Yes,Phenomenological approach,Yes,"",Partial η²,"",20.3333,5.04315,21,"","","","","","",19.6500,5.60334,20,"",17.1429,5.45239,21,"","","","","","",22.1000,4.25379,20,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",0.001,0.261,"","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","See ""Table 18.

""The experimental group
participated in the SMMI, while the control group listened to an interview about mindfulness.
Findings revealed that while mindfulness was negatively correlated with baseline PD,
neuroticism had a positive association with anxiety. Furthermore, mindfulness marginally
negatively predicted variance in post-PD level in both groups, while in the experimental group,
conscientiousness uniquely positively predicted variance in the post-SVB level, and extraversion
was a unique positive predictor of the variance in the post-PD level following the SMMI. There
was a trend for the post-HR scores to be lower in the experimental condition. Both groups had
participants who improved on all three measures of PD (the SMMI-responders and Control
Condition (CC)-responders). Greater mindfulness in the SMMI-responders was associated with
an elevated HR and SVB at the baseline, followed by SVB’s rapid decrease as a result of the
SMMI. Also, the SMMI -responders had cardiovascular measures highly correlated with each
other and the self-report measures of PD. Possibly, a combination of a placebo effect and a
demand effect played a role in the self-reported improvement of PD in CC- responders""",USA,"",No,"","","","","""undergraduate students from a

During the following days, you will repeat this exercise twice a day, for 20
minutes, before the morning and evening meals. If it is impossible at that
particular time, try to do it a little later.
Thus, you should find a calm and normally lit room, somewhere between bright
daylight and darkness. Try to avoid being disturbed during the exercise by
the telephone or any other loud noise.
Then, sit in the most comfortable position for you, your spinal cord straight
and leaning against a flat vertical surface, so as not t o fall asleep. Take care
to free your abdomen to facilitate respiration.
After that, close your eyes and wait half a minute before starting the exercise
itself which consists in counting your respiration (count 1 for inspiration and
expiration) from 1 to 10, and start again at 1, and so on. If you lose count
during the exercise, do not try to recall where you were but simply start over
at 1 and keep on.
During the course of the exercise, you will notice that thoughts, feelings,
sensory distractions will appear; you should not try t o fight these but wait
until it becomes easy to resume the exercise.
After 20 minutes, stop the exercise and wait 3 more minutes before opening
your eyes.
You will now do the exercise in my presence; when the 20 minutes are over,
I will let you know and you will reopen your eyes 3 minutes later. You can

the one you have been practising over the past 15 days.

Now you will stop counting in order to concentrate on the breathing process
itself. You will breathe as usual without any effort or restraint. Your attention
should be on your inspiration and expiration. Follow the entrance of the air
through the nose down to the lungs and from there toward the outside.
Your breathing may be long or short. This is not important. Breathe naturally.

practice called centering prayer developed by the Desert Fathers
and Mothers in the third century (Keating, 2002). The focus
of centering prayer is interior silence which the early Christian
mystics to develop deeper communion with God. Like other
concentration meditations that use a symbol for focus (Goleman,
1988), practitioners select a word or symbol they hold sacred
(e.g., Shalom, hope) and use it to bring back their mind from
distractions. However, unlike many other meditations, centering
prayer focuses not on the mind but rather areas of spiritual
connection. In completative texts, it is called the “return of
the heart” (Pennington, 1980, p. 62) or “attention of the heart”
(Bourgeault, 2004, p. 113). The term centering stems from the
idea that the meditator finds their core center and awakens to
awareness of divine presence inside them.""

""1. Select a word or symbol that you consider spiritually
grounding for you (e.g., a name for God or spiritual concepts
like Shalom, hope, or joy) and represents your intention to
connect with what is spiritual to you.
2. At the beginning of the meditation, sit down comfortably with
your eyes closed (preferably away from external distractions)
and silently introduce your sacred word or symbol.
3. After you do this, you’ll probably notice distracting thoughts
emerging or mind wandering. That’s okay. When you notice
yourself becoming distracted, just ever-so-gently reintroduce
your sacred word or symbol.
4. At the end of your meditation, just sit and rest in silence or say
a prayer for a few moments.""","","","",online training video,"","","","","","","",nm,"","","",9 mean s,"","","",28,"","","",Passive RCT,Other: online training video,None,No,Yes,Education about mindfulness or the meditation pracitce,More than 75% of intervention is meditation practice,None mentioned,Mantra Meditation,None,None,Wait-List Control,"",nm,nm,"","","","","",Stress,Mindfulness (trait),"","","","","",2,"","Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1994)",nm,nm,"Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness

practice called centering prayer developed by the Desert Fathers
and Mothers in the third century (Keating, 2002). The focus
of centering prayer is interior silence which the early Christian
mystics to develop deeper communion with God. Like other
concentration meditations that use a symbol for focus (Goleman,
1988), practitioners select a word or symbol they hold sacred
(e.g., Shalom, hope) and use it to bring back their mind from
distractions. However, unlike many other meditations, centering
prayer focuses not on the mind but rather areas of spiritual
connection. In completative texts, it is called the “return of
the heart” (Pennington, 1980, p. 62) or “attention of the heart”
(Bourgeault, 2004, p. 113). The term centering stems from the
idea that the meditator finds their core center and awakens to
awareness of divine presence inside them.""

""1. Select a word or symbol that you consider spiritually
grounding for you (e.g., a name for God or spiritual concepts
like Shalom, hope, or joy) and represents your intention to
connect with what is spiritual to you.
2. At the beginning of the meditation, sit down comfortably with
your eyes closed (preferably away from external distractions)
and silently introduce your sacred word or symbol.
3. After you do this, you’ll probably notice distracting thoughts
emerging or mind wandering. That’s okay. When you notice
yourself becoming distracted, just ever-so-gently reintroduce
your sacred word or symbol.
4. At the end of your meditation, just sit and rest in silence or say
a prayer for a few moments.""","","","","Asynchronous guiding by a recorded voice, video,  written instructions on centering prayer","","","","","","","",nm,"","","",9 mean s,"","","",28,"","","",Passive RCT,Asynchronous guiding by a recorded voice (e.g. App); Other: written instructions for centering prayer,None,No,Yes,Education about mindfulness or the meditation pracitce,More than 75% of intervention is meditation practice,None mentioned,Mantra Meditation,None,None,Wait-List Control,"",nm,nm,"","","","","",Stress,Mindfulness (trait),Other: ,"",Other: ,"","",2,"","Perceived Stress Scale (PSS; Cohen et al., 1994)",nm,nm,"Cognitive and Affective Mindfulness
